# Gargame

(Yeah, okay, I'm not totally sold on the name either...)

This is my project aimed at building a small but fully-functional HTML5/Canvas game engine in TypeScript.

Please note that this is a _very_ long way from being useful for any real game projects, so I definitely recommend against using it for now. There are no docs, minimal test coverage, very few features, and probably tons of bugs. This will all be ironed out eventually, but for now it's just kind of a hackfest to try to get things off the ground.

If you're looking for a robust solution in the meantime, you may want to check out [Excalibur](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur) instead.
