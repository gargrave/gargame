# Gargame

An HTML5/Canvas game engine, written in TypeScript.

Please note that this is a _very_ long way from being useful for any real game projects, so I definitely recommend against using it for now. There are no docs, minimal test coverage, very few features, and probably tons of bugs. This will all be ironed out eventually, but for now it's just kind of a hackfest to try to get things off the ground.

If you _must_ try it, you can install it with `yarn add @gargrave/gargame`, but I make no promises as to how usable, compatible, etc. it is right now. YMMV!

In the future, there will be better docs, example games, and such. For now, though, it's more or less no-man's land.

If you're looking for a robust solution in the meantime, you may want to check out [Excalibur](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur) instead.
