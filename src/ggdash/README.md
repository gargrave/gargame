 # ggdash
 
 `ggdash` is a super-light "Lodash-like" general utils library, originally built for use with my [Gargame](https://github.com/gargrave/gargame) game engine.
 
 A few notes you should be aware of:
 
 - This is _not_ intended to be a replacement, competitor, or "better version" of Lodash. In 99.9% of use cases, you are probably better off using Lodash.
 - I have directly re-implemented some of Lodash's functions (e.g. `get`), but again, I am not including as much flexibility as you will find in the Lodash versions--this is entirely meant to be a minimal barebones version of exactly what I find myself needing in developing Gargame, primarily for the benefit of minimizing the number of NPM modules I would need to depend on.
